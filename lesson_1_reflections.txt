How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I dont need to inspect whole file. Only changed lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    A lot of posibilities, revert, inspect etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you deside when is smthng is done
    cons: you forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    allow to get state of all file on every commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows brief histiry, git diff - shows what actualy changes in files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    dont afraid to break all and revert all chenges

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
